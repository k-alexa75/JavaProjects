Description: 

The organizers of a motorcycling competition use a software system to manage the registration of participants in the competition. People at the registration offices use a desktop application with the following features: 

1.Login. After successful authentication, a new window opens in which the available races are displayed depending on the engine capacity (125mc, 250mc, etc.) and the number of participants already registered for each race.

2.Search. After successful authentication, the person in the office can search for all participants belonging to a certain team (eg Suzuki, Honda, etc.). Application displays in another list / other table all participants (participant name and engine capacity).

3.Registration. The person can register new participants. When registering a new participant, the engine capacity is selected, and the name of the participant and the team to which he belongs (if any) are entered. After registering, all people from the other offices see the updated list of races and the number of participants registered for each race. 

4.Logout.
